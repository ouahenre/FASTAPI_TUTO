A biologist said that there are 150 different IRIS flowers in the world but these flowers can be classified into 3 different species: iris vergicolor, iris verginica, iris cetosa
Our classification model seeks to predict a flower species based on its characteristics: length and width of cep and petal.

In this exercice three files are generated:
- iris-ml.ipynb:  code of the machine learning creation in jupiter notebook
- logreg.joblib : the model of ML via iris-ml.ipynb
- main.py : this is necessary to execute the model. We use fastAPI and uvicorn
